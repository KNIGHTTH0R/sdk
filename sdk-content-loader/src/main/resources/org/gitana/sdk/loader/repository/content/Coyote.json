    "details":"The name coyote is borrowed from Mexican Spanish, ultimately derived from the Nahuatl word cóyotl.[10] Its scientific name, Canis latrans, means \"barking dog\" in Latin.[11] Preliminary genetic evidence, however, has shown that \"coyotes\" in some areas are, genetically speaking, 85–90% Canis latrans, and from 10 to 15% Canis lupus, along with some domestic dog DNA; this prompted one researcher to suggest, jokingly, that they be called \"Canis soupus,\" as they are a \"soup\" (mixture) of canid species.[12]",
