    "name":"Pika",
    "details":"The pika (play /ˈpaɪkə/ py-kə; archaically spelled pica) is a small mammal, with short limbs, rounded ears, and short tail. The name pika is used for any member of the Ochotonidae, a family within the order of lagomorphs, which also includes the Leporidae (rabbits and hares). One genus, Ochotona, is recognised within the family, and it includes 30 species. It is also known as the \"whistling hare\" due to its high-pitched alarm call when diving into its burrow. The name \"pika\" appears to be derived from the Tungus piika.",
