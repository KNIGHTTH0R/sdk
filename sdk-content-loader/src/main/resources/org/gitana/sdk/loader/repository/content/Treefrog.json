    "details":"The Pacific Tree Frog (Pseudacris regilla) was once considered a single species of chorus frog, called the \"Pacific Chorus Frog.\" However, in 2006 the species was divided into three species. These frogs have a range from the West Coast of the United States (from Northern California, Oregon, and Washington) to British Columbia, in Canada. They live from sea level to more than 10,000 feet in many types of habitats, reproducing in aquatic settings. They are the only frogs that go \"ribbit\". They come in shades of greens or browns and can change colors over periods of hours and weeks.",
