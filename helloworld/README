# Cloud CMS Hello World

This directory contains a simple example of using Cloud CMS.
It's a nodejs webserver using the express framework.
- connect to Cloud CMS
- access the "content" datastore and the "master" branch
- create, query and delete nodes in that branch


## Requirements

Install Node.js
npm install cloudcms-cli -g




## Prior to running the first time

cloudcms init

cloudcms connect
    choose the "Sample Web Site" that is created automatically
        if you've deleted that application, then select another project you have created
        or use "cloudcms create" to create a new application
    choose the default deployment
    note: this creates a gitana.json file that the express app uses as credentials to connect to Cloud CMS
        alternatively, you can provide the credentials directly as the first argument
        to Gitana.connect() in app.js






## To run the server

node app.js



connect to the server using a browser at the following addresses
    http://localhost:3000/init
      - create some nodes in Cloud CMS
    http://localhost:3000
      - query all nodes that have been created
    http://localhost:3000/teardown
      - delete the nodes that have been created


it takes a few seconds for the connection with Cloud CMS to complete
  if you access the webserver during this time,
  a message instructing you to retry in a few seconds will display instead
