# Hello World AngularJS

This directory provides a simple browser application that connects to the Cloud CMS Sample Project on your
tenant and pulls back a list of repositories.  It is based off of the [root]/helloworld-browser in this repository.

You can use this project as a way to test out a simple AngularJS-based HTML web page connecting to Cloud CMS.

## Sample #1 (index.html)

The first sample connects to Cloud CMS using a local proxy.  The proxy is started using Grunt and the
Grunt Connect proxy module.  The proxy starts up at the /proxy URI.  Any URL that starts with /proxy will be forwarded
to the api.cloudcms.com server.  The proxy allows your web app to provide a "same domain" endpoint for XHR/Ajax
connections that originate in the browser.

In production, you will likely want to use Apache or Nginx as a production proxy.

## How to launch the web server

Simply do:

    npm install
    npm start


Look up authentication and application information at https://[your-sub-domain].cloudcms.net/#/developers
and add them to `./GITANA_CREDENTIALS.js`.

And then point your browser to:

    http://localhost:3000/index.html

Note:  including credentials in a js file accessible from a browser should never be used in production.
