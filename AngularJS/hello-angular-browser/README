# Hello World AngularJS

This directory provides a simple browser application that connects to the Cloud CMS Sample Project on your
tenant and pulls back a list of repositories.  It is based off of the [root]/helloworld-browser in this repository.

You can use this project as a way to test out a simple AngularJS-based HTML web page connecting to Cloud CMS.

## Sample #1 (index.html)

The first sample connects to Cloud CMS using a local proxy.  The proxy is started using Grunt and the
Grunt Connect proxy module.  The proxy starts up at the /proxy URI.  Any URL that starts with /proxy will be forwarded
to the api.cloudcms.com server.  The proxy allows your web app to provide a "same domain" endpoint for XHR/Ajax
connections that originate in the browser.

Don't forget to update index.html's Gitana.connect configuration object
with your credentials.  You can look up the credentials at https://your-sub-domain.cloudcms.net/#/developers

In production, you will likely want to use Apache or Nginx as a production proxy.

## Sample #2 (index-using-appserver.html)

The Cloud CMS hosted application tier (*.cloudcms.net) is a cluster of web-facing servers that Cloud CMS runs in the
cloud to provide application server support to your browser-based application.  You can connect to this to have
your client key and client secret automatically provisioned to your app.

This sample requires only the URL of your hosted application which you can get by deploying your application to the
Cloud CMS hosting tier.  Once you have this URL, plug it in to the HTML source to connect.

## How to launch the web server

Simply do:

    npm install
    npm start

And then point your browser to:

    http://localhost:3000/index.html
    http://localhost:3000/index-using-appserver.html
