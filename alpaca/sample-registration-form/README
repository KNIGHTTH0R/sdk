# Simple Registration Form

This repository provides a simple Alpaca form whose schema and options are loaded from content model
definitions and forms that are stored within Cloud CMS.

In addition, this example demonstrates how to post form information to Cloud CMS and collect it within a data list.

## Load the Sample Data

This sample relies upon sample data that can be acquired by installing the Cloud CMS Sample Forms Project.  Without
this data, the sample can still be used as a reference for how to set up a standalone Alpaca form.

## Build Project

To install the project, you should run:

    bower install

This requires of course that you have Bower installed first.

## Configure your connection information

Edit the js/sample.js file and fill in your API Key information for:

- application
- clientKey
- clientSecret
- username
- password

## Start the Web Server

Mount a web server to the local directory and enjoy.

If you're running a Mac, you can do:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

And then check out:

    http://localhost:8000
