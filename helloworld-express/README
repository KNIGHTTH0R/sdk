# Cloud CMS Hello World using Express framework

This directory contains a simple example of using Cloud CMS.
It's a nodejs webserver using the express framework.
- connect to Cloud CMS
- access the "content" datastore and the "master" branch
- create, query and delete nodes in that branch
- respond to http requests with query results


## Requirements
    Install Node.js
    npm install




## Credentials

the server needs credentials to be able to connect to Cloud CMS
they can be provided directly as the first argument in the call to Gitana.connect (see app.js)
or they can be saved in a file named gitana.json in this directory
  and Gitana.connect will read them automatically



Automated Method

    npm install -g cloudcms-cli
    cloudcms init
    cloudcms connect
        choose the "Sample Web Site" that is created automatically
            if you've deleted that application, then select another project you have created
            or use "cloudcms create" to create a new application
        choose the default deployment
        this will generate a gitana.json

Manual Method
    visit http://__tenant__.cloudcms.net/#/developers
    where __tenant__ is the domain that you signed up with
    click "gitana.json"
    highlight and copy the json
    and save it as a file named "gitana.json" in this directory
        alternatively, you can paste it into app.js and assign it to the variable credentials





## To run the server

node app.js



connect to the server using a browser at the following addresses
    http://localhost:3000/init
      - create some nodes in Cloud CMS
    http://localhost:3000
      - query all nodes that have been created
    http://localhost:3000/teardown
      - delete the nodes that have been created


it takes a few seconds for the connection with Cloud CMS to complete
  if you access the webserver during this time,
  a message instructing you to retry in a few seconds will display instead
