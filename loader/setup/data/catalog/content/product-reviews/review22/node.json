So, who better than us to take a stab at creating a unique flavor that almost sings with the palate. If you’re not tempted with this lustful dance of flavors then you’re obviously not a fan of light and fluffy chocolate cake. But, if you’re in the mood to be swept off your feet then read information below about how Fate cakes can deliver this beauty right to your front door. Or, if you’re thinking of flirting with a friend, send them a gift in the mail! Either way, our Columbus, OH cupcake bakery offers custom flavors which you taste buds will fall in love with.",
